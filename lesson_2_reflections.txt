What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create the .git repository which will hold everything you need.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?

It contains the files that you want to commit, which might be different than all the files in the
working directory. The value is that you get total control over what you want to commit, so not
everything has to be updated.
