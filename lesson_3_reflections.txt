When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that you can easily collaborate or show your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

You might be working on a file with certain code, and your new code is based around that code. If 
you automatically get it from github that might change, the old code which might not be compatible
with the code you just wrote.
