When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that you can easily collaborate or show your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

You might be working on a file with certain code, and your new code is based around that code. If 
you automatically get it from github that might change, the old code which might not be compatible
with the code you just wrote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

A branch allows you to move away from the current path, and create a new one which has a specific 
change that makes it distinct enough to be different, kind of like creating a slightly different story.

A clone copies over the file and allows you to work on edit the files, or add to the repository. Changes
to a clone will change the original repo's wherever you cloned it from.

A fork gives you a copy that links back to the original owners, but the changes to this fork will 
not show up in the owners. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You're able to see any changes that could have been made even if you're offline. It allows you
to easily the see the difference between your code and what might now be on the github page. 
Allowing you to easily fix conflicts.
